## Text-Sentiment-detection
Text sentiment detection
I have constructed a web application that performs text emotion detection and classification using Streamlit and Python. 
This project involves processing input text and categorizing it into various emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, neutrality, anger, shame, and more, 
utilizing the techniques of Natural Language Processing.
